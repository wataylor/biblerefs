<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of this site is to facilitate Bible study.  The
most basic function is looking up Bible passages such as Ge. 1:1 or
Genesis 1:1-10 so that you can paste them into sermons and papers.</p>

<P>If you type a Bible reference into the input field and hit the
&lt;Enter&gt; key or mouse the "Find" button, the program looks up the
Bible passage and puts it at the end of the accumulated passages.
This makes it simple to cite scripture passages - just copy the text
and paste it into your word processor.</p>

<P>The "Clear" button erases the accumulated verses.</P>

<p>The radio button selects the first language to be displayed.  The
checkboxes select additional languages to be displayed in parallel.  If
no checkboxes are selected, only the first language is displayed.</p>

<h3>Cross References</h3>

<p>If you check the "Include Cross References" box, the program includes
cross references with the passage.  If you put the mouse over a cross
reference, the text of the related verse shows for a while.  If you
click a cross reference, the text of the reference verse is added to
the accumulation.</p>

<P>A great deal of effort has gone into preparing the cross reference
list, but errors creep in and reasonable men may differ on whether
verses are related or not.  If you disagree with a cross reference, if
you believe that the verses are <i>not</i> related, click the - near
the cross reference.  The program will note your doubts about the
relationship and we'll take a look.</p>

<P>If, on the other hand, you note that we have omitted a cross
reference, hit the + near a verse and you'll get a form into which to
enter your suggestion.</p>

<P>I Corinthians 3:9 says that when we do the Lord's work, we are
laborers <I>together with God.</i> We appreciate your help in
verifying the work.
